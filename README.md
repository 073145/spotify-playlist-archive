> Daily snapshots of public Spotify playlists

I like Spotify's playlists. I like that they're updated once in a while -
change is good! I don't like, however, that it's impossible to see older
versions. How am I supposed to remember the name of that song I really liked?
Apparently, I'm not alone: see

Since Spotify won't take snapshots of our favorite playlists, let's do it ourselves!

## Quick start

1. To add a playlist to the archive, simply `touch playlists/plain/<playlist_id>` and make a pull request
1. To view the current version of a playlist, click on its name below, or look in `playlists/pretty/`
1. To determine which songs were added or removed from a playlist, look at the history for `playlists/plain/<playlist_id>`

## How it works

This reposity contains a script for scraping Spotify playlists and publishing
them back to the repo. The script is run daily via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
(free for public GitHub repos). It's also run after every commit, which means
that playlists get regenerated whenever the scraping or formatting logic
changes, or when new playlists are added - cool!

The script determines which playlists to scrape by looking at the file names in
`playlists/plain`. Anything that's not a valid playlist ID gets removed. Files
that *are* a valid playlist IDs get regenerated: a pretty version of each
playlist gets dumped in `playlists/pretty`, and a plain version is written back
to the file. The plain version is sorted by track ID, rather than track number,
to ensure it only changes when tracks are added or removed.

The list below is autogenerated.
